# Using the Native Title Bar

You can use the native title bar of each platform (Is set as true by default on Linux).

To do this go to preferences -> `window: title bar style` and set it to native.

You can also set this in `settings.json` with `"window.titleBarStyle": "native"`

#### You can also enable Command Center layout for vscode
set `"window.commandCenter": true`
